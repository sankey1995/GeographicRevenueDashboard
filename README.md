# GeographicRevenueDashboard Using Power Bi

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of geographic revenue performance. Starting with an Excel file, we cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query, including checking all columns data types and removing duplicate files. We then created several KPIs to retrieve insights and created charts such as a filled map, donut chart, line clustered chart, line chart, and waterfall chart.
The result is a dynamic dashboard that enables easy navigation and slicers to filter data based on regions, cities, and locations. The dashboard is interactive, with drill-down capabilities that allow users to explore the data in more detail.
